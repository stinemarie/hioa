    <h1>Drink water</h1>
    <p>
      The human body contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body
      size. To function properly, the body requires between one and
      seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise
      amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity,
      and other factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who have healthy kidneys, it is rather difficult to
      drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and
      while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans require water with few impurities. Common impurities
      include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium
      and lead, and/or harmful bacteria.
