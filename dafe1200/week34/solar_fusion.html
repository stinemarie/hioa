      The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the
      gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular
      cloud. Most of the matter gathered in the center, while the rest
      flattened into an orbiting disk that would become the Solar
      System. The central mass became increasingly hot and dense,
      eventually initiating thermonuclear fusion in its core.

      The power production by fusion in the core varies with distance
      from the solar center. At the center of the Sun, theoretical
      models estimate it to be approximately 276.5 watts/m3, a power
      production density that more nearly approximates reptile
      metabolism than a thermonuclear bomb.Peak power production in
      the Sun has been compared to the volumetric heats generated in
      an active compost heap. The tremendous power output of the Sun
      is not due to its high power per volume, but instead due to its
      large size.
